The libraries distributed here are for further developments within a custom application.
They are NOT designed to run independently, but only to support implementers of a custom backend application to manage the message structure of the domibusConnectorAPI and to connect to the domibusConnector to submit or receive messages.

Libraries included in the package:

* domibusConnectorAPI
* domibusConnectorClientLibsAPI
* domibusConnectorClientWSLink
* domibusConnectorClientLibrary
* domibusConnectorClientScheduler


=== domibusConnectorAPI

This library is provided by the domibusConnector. It includes the definition of the services the domibusConnector provides and serves.
An XSD describing the transition model of the message structure the domibusConnector expects is also included as well as Java classes generated from the XSD. 

=== domibusConnectorClientLibsAPI

==== Description
Over the whole domibusConnectorClientLibraries, a common API defines interfaces that are used of the modules (libraries) to communicate with each other. Those interfaces can be implemented/overridden by developers in case the libraries are used. Some *_must_* be implemented. Most interfaces have a default implementation to support the developer in the beginning. All interfaces are well described in the link:apidocs/index.html[API docs,window=_tab] of this package.
This overview picture above as well as all architecture images only contain the interfaces that are used within the environment that is pictured.

=== domibusConnectorClientWSLink

image::images/domibusConnectorClientWSLink.png[domibusConnectorClientWSLink,300,200]

==== Description
This library controls the communication between the client and the domibusConnector.
It builds the webservice client for the domibusConnectorBackendWebService. 

If configured properly it also builds the domibusConnectorBackendDeliveryWebService as a push service. In that case, the domibusConnector can directly push messages to the client and the time-triggered job to receive messages from the connector is obsolete.

____

Important: If the push mode is enabled and the client is configured to receive messages from the connector directly, then the client also needs to be configured properly using that mode within the configuration of the domibusConnector!

____

Furthermore, it loads the keystore and builds the ws-security for the webservices.

The properties required, their description and default values (if implemented) for this library are decribed in the link:configuration.html[Configuration] menu of this page with pre-fix "connector-client.connector-link.ws". 

=== domibusConnectorClientLibrary

[#img-domibusConnectorClientLibrary]
[link=images/domibusConnectorClientLibrary.png,window=_tab]
image::images/domibusConnectorClientLibrary.png[domibusConnectorClientLibrary,300,200]

==== Description
The domibusConnectorClientLibrary is the main library of the package. 
To use this library, also the *domibusConnectorClientWSLink* needs to be on the classpath.

==== Contained implementations
* *DomibusConnectorClientMessageBuilderImpl* 
** Implements  link:apidocs/eu/domibus/connector/client/DomibusConnectorClientMessageBuilder.html[*DomibusConnectorClientMessageBuilder*,window=_tab] 
** Helps to create transition messages.
* *DomibusConnectorClientMessageHandlerImpl*
** Implements link:apidocs/eu/domibus/connector/client/DomibusConnectorClientMessageHandler.html[*DomibusConnectorClientMessageHandler*,window="_tab"] 
** Prepares a message's business content XML. Depending on the direction of the message, it calls international/local schema validator, content mapper and local/international schema validator.
* *DomibusConnectorClientImpl* 
** Implements link:apidocs/eu/domibus/connector/client/DomibusConnectorClient.html[*DomibusConnectorClient*,window="_tab"]
** Main implementation class of this library. Calls the domibusConnectorClientWSLink library to receive messages from the domibusConnector and submits messages to the domibusConnector. 
* *DomibusConnectorDeliveryClientImpl*
** Implements link:apidocs/eu/domibus/connector/client/DomibusConnectorDeliveryClient.html[*DomibusConnectorDeliveryClient*,window="_tab"]
** If push mode is enabled and configured properly this implementation class routes messages received from the domibusConnector via push to the DomibusConnectorClientBackend. 

=== domibusConnectorClientScheduler

[link=images/domibusConnectorClientScheduler.png,window=_tab]
image::images/domibusConnectorClientScheduler.png[domibusConnectorClientScheduler,300,200]

==== Description
This library is an extension to the domibusConnectorClientLibrary. 
It manages time-triggered jobs to receive/submit messages from/to the domibusConnector.

==== Contained time-triggered jobs
*GetMessagesFromConnectorJob* triggers every configurable time period to call the domibusConnector for new messages that have not been delivered yet. The messages are then routed to the *DomibusConnectorClientBackend*. The properties required, their description and default values (if implemented) for this library are decribed in the link:configuration.html[Configuration] menu of this page with pre-fix "connector-client.scheduler.get-messages-from-connector-job".

*SubmitMessagesToConnectorJob* triggers every configurable time period to call the *DomibusConnectorClientBackend* for new messages on the backend of the client to submit them to the domibusConnector. To work properly, the *DomibusConnectorClientBackend* interface *_must_* be implemented. The properties required, their description and default values (if implemented) for this library are decribed in the link:configuration.html[Configuration] menu of this page with pre-fix "connector-client.scheduler.submit-messages-to-connector-job".
