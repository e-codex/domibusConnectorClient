== Configuration properties of the domibusConnectorClient-Libraries

If the libraries contributed in this package are integrated into an application, the following configuration properties need to be available within the application context.
If default values are set, those are also set as values for the properties described.
Some properties described only have placeholders set as values:

[source,properties]

#Name of the alias of the key that the domibusConnectorClient shall encrypt messages to the connector with
connector-client.connector-link.ws.cxf.encryptAlias=

#boolean property to indicate wether the domibusConnector can push messages to the client.
connector-client.connector-link.ws.pushEnabled=false

#properties to configure the keystore. Must contain the private key the client uses to sign/decrypt messages
connector-client.connector-link.ws.cxf.keyStore.path=file:<full path to the keystore>

connector-client.connector-link.ws.cxf.privateKey.alias=
connector-client.connector-link.ws.cxf.privateKey.password=

#properties to configure the truststore. Must contain the certificate of the domibusConnector with which the client encrypts messages with

############# domibusConnectorClientLibrary ##############

#If the interfaces for schema validation are implemented, this property defines at which state of result the message should be declined.
#Possible values are FATAL_ERROR, ERROR, WARNING

#properties to configure the time-triggered job to check the client backend for new messages to submit.
