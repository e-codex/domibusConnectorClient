The libraries distributed here are for further developments within a custom application.
They are NOT designed to run independently, but only to support implementers of a custom backend application to manage the message structure of the domibusConnectorAPI and to connect to the domibusConnector to submit or receive messages.

Libraries included in the package:

* domibusConnectorAPI
* domibusConnectorClientAPI
* domibusConnectorClientWSLink
* domibusConnectorClientLibrary
* domibusConnectorClientScheduler


=== domibusConnectorAPI

This library is provided by the domibusConnector. It includes the definition of the services the domibusConnector provides and serves.
An XSD describing the transition model of the message structure the domibusConnector expects is also included as well as Java classes generated from the XSD. 

=== domibusConnectorClientAPI

Over the whole domibusConnectorClient a common API defines interfaces that are used of the modules (libraries) to communicate with each other. Those interfaces can be implemented by developers if the libraries are used. Some must be implemented. Most interfaces have default a implementation to support the developer in the beginning. The interfaces are well described in the javadoc of this package.
This overview picture above as well as all architecture images only contain the interfaces that are used within the environment that is pictured.

=== domibusConnectorClientWSLink

[#img-domibusConnectorClientWSLink]

image::images/domibusConnectorClientWSLink.png[domibusConnectorClientWSLink,300,200]

This library controls the communication between the client and the domibusConnector.
It builds the webservice client for the domibusConnectorBackendWebService and, if configured, the domibusConnectorBackendDeliveryWebService.
Furthermore, it loads the keystore and builds the ws-security for the webservices.
The properties required, their description and default values (if implemented) are decribed in "Project Documentation -> Project Reports -> Spring Properties" with pre-fix "connector-client.connector-link.ws".

=== domibusConnectorClientLibrary

The domibusConnectorClientLibrary is the main library of the package. It contains default implementations for most external interfaces:

* DomibusConnectorClientMessageBuilderImpl 
** Implements the DomibusConnectorClientMessageBuilder interface. 
** Helps to create transition messages.
* DomibusConnectorClientContentMapperDefaultImpl
** Implements the DomibusConnectorClientContentMapper. 
** If no mapping of business content is required, this default implementation is sufficient. It validates if the business content of a message is set.
* DomibusConnectorClientImpl 
** Implements the DomibusConnectorClient interface.
** 


____

Note: The evidence is generated by the connector but the generation of some evidences must be triggered
by the business application.

Part of this package is also a export of the connector architecture created within
enterprise architect. You can access the documentation if you open the
documentation folder within the domibusConnectorDistribution package
or here link:../architecture/index.html[architecture].
